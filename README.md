# ClassicStockResources
An alternative resource set for Kerbal Space Program
Created by Angel-125 and JadeOfMaar

Back in KSP 0.19, developers NovaSilisko and HarvesteR proposed a resource system that included Propellium, Oxium, Nitronite, Water, Blutonium, Hexagen, and Zeonium that ultimately converted into the resources we know today as LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, and XenonGas. You can see their concept image here:

Classic Stock is inspired by their vision and adds some additional resources for use in your converters and storage containers. For examples of its use, mods by Wild Blue Industries make extensive use of the Classic Stock resource system. 
As a niche mod, it enables many things that the Community Resource Pack does but with a working asteroid scanning function and without needing to provide a very lengthy resource library that usually goes over 50% unused at a given time by most players.

## Resources
* **Atmosphere**: Equivalent to IntakeAtm, it is the raw catch-all resource for intakes that don't depend on Oxygen, and for any engines that also don't need Oxygen. Prospectors that work in atmosphere and in space are able to sift all other raw resources out of this once they are present at the current celestial body.
* **Blutonium**: Raw radioactive material which is dug up from the ground.
* **Explodium**: Equivalent of Nuclear Saltwater. Do not attempt to swim in, ingest, or in any other way handle with bare skin. It is a compound of Blutonium and Water. If and when you separate them...would you drink the Water? 
* **Gemstones**: Precious stones with all colors and internal arrangements. Their primary purpose is for funding the next great mission.
* **GrayWater**: Water is not actually clean as we know it by default. Drinkable, otherwise pure water nearly always must be filtered from this.
* **Hexagen**: The Helium-alike resource. Very plentiful at stars and gas planets. It is the standard option for fusion drive propellant, and the fuel for compatible fusion reactor power sources.
* **Hydrokerbon**: Raw material rich in hydrons and rich in kerbons. It converts with 100% efficiency into two propellants that are greater than and equal to LiquidFuel, and can be fissioned for Propellium.
* **IntakeLqd**: Equivalent to Atmosphere but for prospectors that operate only while splashed and submerged.
* **Minerite**: Particular common materials not found in Ore such as salts and semi-precious crystals.
* **Nitronite**: A powerful Nitro-bearing compound, very versatile and largely produced by microbes. It is a key component in the production of MonoPropellant and LFO, is an inefficient propellant in itself, is useful in distillers, and can be used to turn frowns upside down! It's plentiful here on Kerbin but we're not quite sure about other planets yet...
* **Oxium**: Pure Oxygen. Less awkward than "Oxidizer" for use in potential resource chains not involved with propellants.
* **PreciousMetals**: Rare, high value metals. Their primary purpose is for funding the next great mission but they can also serve very well in industrial processes.
* **Propellium**: Cryogenic fuel, liquid hydrons. It is best found very near stars and at gas giants.
* **Rock**: Can be found/treated as space dust. More abundant than Ore and the major constituent of planets. Can contain Ore. Easiest to harvest. Does not convert well but can be effective in a pinch.
* **Slag**: Waste product from Ore refinement, major component of Konkrete.
* **Water**: As you know it, pure and usable for many processes, but it is not all-present by default. In most cases it needs to be filtered from GrayWater.
* **Zeonium**: Crystalline and like a fine powder, contains XenonGas and possibly other noble gases. Abundance may be biased towards particularly hostile planets. It can be found in crust and in atmosphere.
